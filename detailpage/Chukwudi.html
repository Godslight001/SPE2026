        CNG Ecosystem in Nigeria: 
        Strategies for Safe, Reliable and 
        Affordable Fuel Solutions</strong></h3>
    <div  class="session-synopsis">
        <Strong>Synopsis: </Strong>
        As Nigeria transitions towards cleaner energy solutions, developing a sustainable Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) ecosystem is critical to reducing carbon emissions and achieving energy affordability. This session examines the strategic pillars required to build a robust CNG framework that addresses safety, reliability, and affordability in fuel solutions. Key focus areas include establishing infrastructure for CNG production, storage, and distribution, alongside integrating advanced technologies for operational efficiency. Addressing safety concerns through stringent regulatory frameworks and public awareness campaigns will also be emphasized to ensure user confidence and system reliability. The session will explore pricing strategies to enhance affordability for consumers and incentivize industry adoption, along with policy reforms to attract investments and promote local manufacturing of CNG components. By leveraging Nigeria’s abundant natural gas reserves, this roadmap aims to foster an energy-efficient economy while supporting sustainable development and environmental conservation goals.
