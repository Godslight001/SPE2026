    <h3 class="session-title"><strong>Digital Transformation in 
        Nigeria's Oil Sector: Enhancing 
        Fiscal Metering through Technology
         </strong></h3>
    <p class="session-synopsis">
        <Strong>Synopsis: </Strong>
        Fiscal metering is essential in the midstream oil and gas sector, ensuring accurate hydrocarbon measurement for revenue allocation, tax calculations, and regulatory compliance. Nigeria, the fifteenth-largest oil producer with an average daily production of 1.5 million barrels in 2023 and 15 operating pipelines, relies heavily on effective fiscal metering systems. However, these systems face significant challenges, including calibration errors, environmental influences, and wear and tear, leading to increasing risks of tampering, fraud, and revenue loss. The Nigeria Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (NEITI) reports that between 2012 and 2015, Nigeria lost over $9.89 billion worth of crude oil due to poor metering infrastructure, with 107 million barrels unaccounted for. More recently, over 250,000 barrels of crude oil are lost daily to theft, amounting to more than $25 million in lost revenue per day. These challenges demand innovative solutions to enhance fiscal metering reliability and efficiency. Digital transformation provides a promising pathway to address these issues. This session offers young professionals and stakeholders an opportunity to explore the adoption of digital technologies for improving fiscal metering securing Nigeria’s economic future.
