        >Roadmap for Refined Crude Oil Pricing and Supply: Challenges and
        Strategic Solutions
      </strong>
    </h3>
    <p class="session-synopsis">
      <strong>Synopsis: </strong>
      The refined crude oil market is a cornerstone of global energy economies, yet it faces persistent challenges, including pricing volatility, supply chain inefficiencies, and market imbalances. This session explores the complexities of refined crude oil pricing, influenced by global crude price fluctuations, geopolitical tensions, and currency instability, which create uncertainty for producers and consumers. Key issues include inefficiencies in refining, transportation, and storage infrastructure, particularly in regions like Nigeria, where regulatory inconsistencies and subsidy policies hinder supply optimization. The session also highlights the critical role of technology in enabling real-time pricing analysis and supply chain management while emphasizing policy reforms for market liberalization and competitive fairness. Attendees will gain a detailed understanding of strategic solutions, including adopting sustainable supply practices, leveraging regional collaborations, and aligning pricing frameworks with economic goals to drive resilience in an evolving global energy landscape.
