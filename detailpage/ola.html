        <p class="speaker-bio">
            Dr. Olatunde Mosobalaje is a faculty member at the Petroleum Engineering Department of Covenant University, where he is currently promoting digital innovations in engineering education. He is a member of the American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE), and the Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE). His commitment to knowledge transfer is unmistakable as it manifest in his ongoing projects aiming at enhancing petroleum engineering curriculum with digital and data analytics contents. In 2023, he was part of a team that designed and published a module on introducing Python coding to petroleum engineering undergraduates – an award-winning effort. Most recently, he played a significant role in a team that developed an integrated framework for the integration of data analytics and machine learning into the petroleum engineering curriculum. He recently founded and is coordinating the Petroleum Data Analytics Special Interest Group (PDA_SIG) of students and young professionals. In teaching, Dr. Mosobalaje adopts a balanced blend of analogical reasoning, concept visualization, field application and workflow coding as a pedagogy style. His research interest is in engineering education, as well as in the deployment of data analytics and machine learning tools to petroleum engineering applications. In a modest way, his research undertakings have produced content-assessment-pedagogy alignment of innovative curriculum ideas, and extended the functionality of some existing geostatistical routines. As a testimonial of his pursuit of excellence in teaching, he received the Dean’s award as the best teacher in the department. He also received the Best Paper award in an international conference featuring over 100 authors from 17 countries, and a bronze medal in another. Notably, Dr. Mosobalaje just got accepted into the 2025 Spring Cohort of the prestigious ‘Empowering-the-Teachers’ (ETT) fellowship, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
