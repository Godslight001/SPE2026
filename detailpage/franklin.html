        <p>
            <strong>Course Overview: </strong>
            Enhancing Refinery Process Efficiency with Aspen HYSYS focuses on leveraging the advanced simulation capabilities of Aspen HYSYS to optimize refinery operations. By creating detailed digital twins of refinery units, engineers can accurately predict unit behavior under various conditions. This allows for the identification of bottlenecks and optimization of operating parameters, leading to increased product yields and reduced energy consumption. Through practical examples and interactive sessions, the course highlights Aspen HYSYS’s applications in monitoring refining processes, and optimizing its workflows, empowering professionals to integrate this cutting-edge technology for operational excellence.
